Trial Number: Trial 2
Date: 2024-11-12
Objective: Test the impact of removing underperforming categories (Unlabeled litter, Other plastic, and Other plastic wrapper) on model performance.

---

Adjustments:
- **Category Removal**: Unlabeled litter, Other plastic, and Other plastic wrapper categories were removed due to poor performance in the baseline model.
- **Hyperparameters**: Kept consistent with Trial 1 to ensure that the results directly reflect the impact of category removal.
  - Model: YOLOv8 large model (`yolov8l.pt`)
  - Epochs: 100
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Patience: 15 (early stopping if no improvement)
  - Freeze Layers: First 10 layers frozen
  - Augmentation: Enabled for generalization across diverse backgrounds

Observations:
- Overall Improvement: Removing the underperforming categories improved overall metrics, with significant increases in precision (from 0.405 to 0.502), recall (from 0.363 to 0.546), and mAP@50 (from 0.320 to 0.494).
- Class Performance: Most classes showed increased mAP@50 scores, particularly Plastic bottle cap and Drink can, suggesting that the model benefited from a reduced number of classes and more focused training.
- Inference Speed: Slight increase in inference time (from 100.4ms to 108.2ms per image), possibly due to higher quality predictions.

Next Steps:
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different batch sizes and learning rates to maximize improvements seen after category removal.
- Augmentation Analysis: Test the impact of various augmentation strategies on each class to further improve generalization.
- Further Class Refinement: Consider additional refinements if certain categories continue to underperform, or introduce regularization to address potential overfitting.

This trial demonstrates the positive impact of focusing the model on classes with sufficient data and better-defined characteristics, setting a clearer path for future optimizations.
