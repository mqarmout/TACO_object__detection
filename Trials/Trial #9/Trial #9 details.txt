**Trial Number**: Trial 9  
**Date**: 2024-11-16  
**Objective**: Build upon the previous model configuration by evaluating the impact of increasing the **scale** parameter to 1 (from 0.5) and the **rotation (degrees)** to 30 (from 10). The goal was to assess whether these augmented transformations improve model performance and generalization.

**Adjustments**:  
- **Continued Configuration**:  
  - Retained the YOLO11 medium model (`yolo11m.pt`) and consistent settings from Trial 8, ensuring comparability in results.  
- **Augmentation Enhancements**:  
  - **Scale**: Increased from 0.5 to 1, allowing objects to appear in a broader size range during training.  
  - **Rotation**: Increased from 10 degrees to 30 degrees to introduce more varied orientations.  
- Other parameters remained the same as in Trial 8:  
  - Learning Rate: `1e-5`  
  - Frozen Layers: 10  
  - Optimizer: Adam  
  - Weight Decay: `5e-4`  
  - Warmup Epochs: 3 (momentum = 0.8)  
  - Additional Augmentations: MixUp (probability 0.2), shear (`shear=2.0`), translation (`translate=0.1`), HSV augmentations (`hsv_h=0.015`, `hsv_s=0.7`, `hsv_v=0.4`), flipping (`flipud=0.0`, `fliplr=0.5`).  
  - Scheduler: Cosine Learning Rate Scheduler  
  - Epochs: 200  
  - Patience: 30  
  - Image Size: 1536  
  - Batch Size: 16

**Observations**:  
- **Impact of Increased Augmentation**:  
  - The broader scaling and rotation range slightly improved **recall** (0.584) and **mAP@50** (0.589), indicating the model's ability to generalize better to diverse object sizes and orientations.  
  - The boost in **mAP@50-95** (0.436) suggests improved localization across IoU thresholds, particularly benefiting harder-to-detect objects.  
- **Class-Specific Trends**:  
  - "Clear plastic bottle" continues to outperform other classes with the highest mAP@50 (0.810) and mAP@50-95 (0.646), demonstrating robustness to the augmented transformations.  
  - "Plastic film," though improved slightly, remains the weakest class, with the lowest mAP@50 (0.398) and mAP@50-95 (0.292).  
  - "Drink can" saw improvements in recall (0.649) and mAP@50-95 (0.569), benefiting from enhanced augmentation.  
- **Efficiency**:  
  - The inference time (9.1 ms per image) is notably faster compared to earlier trials, suggesting optimized processing, despite increased augmentation complexity.

**Next Steps**:  
- **Augmentation Refinement**: Test intermediate values for **scale** and **rotation** (e.g., scale = 0.8, rotation = 20 degrees) to balance diversity and performance.  
- **Class-Specific Augmentations**: Introduce tailored augmentations for "Plastic film" to address its persistent challenges.  
- **Speed Validation**: Analyze the factors behind the significant improvement in inference speed to ensure reliability and consistency.  
- **Model Regularization**: Experiment with additional regularization strategies, such as stochastic weight averaging or targeted dropout layers, to enhance generalization further.  

This trial reinforces the importance of augmentation in improving model robustness, particularly for generalizing across varied object characteristics. Future efforts will focus on fine-tuning augmentation and addressing class-specific weaknesses for more balanced performance.
