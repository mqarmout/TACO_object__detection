# Trials Folder Structure and Documentation Format

This `Trials` folder system is designed to track and document model training progress through sequential trials. Each trial will be stored in its own sub-folder, named sequentially in the order they are completed (e.g., `Trial 1`, `Trial 2`, etc.), regardless of date, to allow for multiple trials on the same day. This structure supports organized, clear documentation and improvement tracking across all team members.

### Folder Structure
- **Trials** folder will contain a sub-folder for each trial (e.g., `Trial 1`, `Trial 2`).
- Each trial sub-folder will include:
  - **Python Notebook(s)**: The Jupyter notebook(s) used for model training, improvements, or parameter changes for that specific trial.
  - **Text File**: A `.txt` file that provides a detailed summary of the trial.

### Text File Format (`Trial_Details.txt`)
Each trial's `.txt` file will document the trial’s specifics, providing a clear record of the reasoning, changes, and observations for that trial. The text file should follow this structure:

1. **Trial Number**: Specify the trial number (consistent with the folder name).
2. **Date**: Include the date when the trial was completed.
3. **Objective**: Briefly state the goal of the trial (e.g., “Optimize learning rate”, “Increase dataset size”).
4. **Adjustments**: List any changes made from the previous trial (e.g., hyperparameters, model architecture, data preprocessing steps).
5. **Reasoning**: Explain the rationale behind the changes made in this trial, detailing why these adjustments were expected to improve performance.
6. **Results**: Summarize the key outcomes of the trial, including model performance metrics.
7. **Observations**: Document any significant insights, such as unexpected behaviors or challenges encountered.
8. **Next Steps**: Outline any proposed adjustments for future trials based on the results of this trial.

### Example Text File Format
```
Trial Number: Trial 1
Date: 2024-11-12
Objective: Optimize learning rate for improved convergence.

Adjustments:
- Learning rate adjusted from 0.001 to 0.0005.
- Batch size increased from 16 to 32.

Reasoning:
- A lower learning rate was chosen to stabilize training and reduce oscillations in loss.
- A larger batch size was selected to improve gradient estimates.

Results:
- Validation accuracy improved from 82% to 85%.
- Training loss decreased steadily, showing a smoother convergence.

Observations:
- Training time increased due to the larger batch size, but model performance improved.
- Some overfitting observed in later epochs; regularization may need adjustment.

Next Steps:
- Introduce dropout layers to control overfitting in future trials.
```

### Python Notebook Naming Convention
Each trial’s notebook should be named with the trial number and date (e.g., `Trial_1_2024-11-12.ipynb`). This naming will help anyone reviewing the folder easily identify the notebook associated with each trial.

### Notes for Team Members
- Only meaningful improvements should be documented; avoid redundant or minor changes.
- Each trial builds upon the last, with explanations in each text file detailing why changes were made and what improvements are anticipated.
- Follow this standardized format to maintain clarity and consistency across all trials.

This documentation format will ensure that the process is transparent, collaborative, and easy to follow.
