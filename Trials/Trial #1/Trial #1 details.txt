Trial Number: Trial 1
Date: 2024-11-12
Objective: Establish a baseline performance with a large YOLO model to detect small objects in complex environments.

---

Adjustments:
- Model Architecture: YOLOv8 large model (`yolov8l.pt`) selected to better handle small objects and complex backgrounds.
- Image Resolution: High resolution (1536x1536) was used to capture detail, crucial for detecting small objects within the dataset.
- Dataset Modification: Categories reduced to include only classes with a significant number of objects, increasing focus on relevant data and reducing noise.
- Hyperparameters:
  - Epochs: 100
  - Batch Size: 16
  - Patience: 15 (early stopping if no improvement)
  - Freeze Layers: First 10 layers frozen to leverage pretrained weights for low-level feature extraction
  - Augmentation: Enabled to help with model generalization on diverse backgrounds

Observations:
- The model architecture and high resolution have resulted in relatively strong performance on classes like Cigarette and Clear plastic bottle, likely due to the modelâ€™s ability to capture finer details at higher resolutions.
- Unlabeled litter, Other plastic wrapper, and Other plastic categories show low precision and recall, indicating difficulties in recognizing these classes in complex backgrounds.
- Average precision (mAP@50) across classes suggests that model adjustments are needed to improve detection, particularly in the challenging background settings.

Next Steps:
- Refine Classes: Consider removing low-performing categories (e.g., Unlabeled litter, Other plastic wrapper, Other plastic) to focus on classes with better detection potential.
- Augmentation Review: Investigate additional or targeted augmentation strategies that might better address the complex backgrounds in the dataset.
- Experiment with Hyperparameters: Consider reducing the batch size or adjusting learning rate to improve model convergence.

This baseline provides a foundation for further tuning and optimizations in subsequent trials.
